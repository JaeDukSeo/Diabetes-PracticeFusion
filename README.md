Predicting diabetic patients using EHR provide by Practice Fusion &amp; Kaggle

In this project, I used data provided by Kaggle and Practice Fusion. Multiple sets of patients information, transcripts, diagnosis, medications and patients allergies were provided in a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pf2012-diabetes) that was closed in 2012. I should note that this is my first data science project in healthcare using EHR.

**Objective:** Build a model to predict positive diabetes

**Procedure**

### 1. Data cleaning
The cleaning of data consisted in:


#### a. Text mining medication names
There is a combination of medications that can weaken a patient and sometimes triggering symptoms of diabetes mellitus. In this notebook, I am going to text mine medication names provided in Practice Fusion datasets with the goal to find components of medications that are linked to risk of diabetes type 2. Results from this notebook will be used to build the [predictive model](https://github.com/kthouz/Diabetes-PracticeFusion/blob/master/3_EDA%20%26%20Model%20Building.ipynb)  [(continue reading ...)](https://github.com/kthouz/Diabetes-PracticeFusion/blob/master/1_Text%20Mining%20-%20Medication%20%26%20Transcript.ipynb)

#### b. Cleaning transcripts and diagnosis
- validating data types
- imputing missing values
- dropping outliers

### 2. EDA, Model building and validation
The process consists in:

1. Loading cleaned data and building one large dataset. containing all information
2. Carrying an exploratory data analysis. I will generate visualization that make it easy to see correlations between independent and dependent variables. In this section, statistical tests will also be used to validate separability of the dependent variable among different groups of the independent variables
3. Building a predictive model. Three different Gradient Boost ML algorithms will be tuned and to optimize the best parameters for final predictions
4. Validating the models

### 5. Summary and recommendations

Three models were built by tuning the Gradient Boost ML algorithm using clean data from patients information, transcripts, diagnosis and medications and they were independently cross-validated. AUC of these models were 0.707 (using numerical variables), 0.680 (using categorical variables) and 0.736 (using text-mined variables). For improvement, a mixture model was then built as a linear combination of the three models. The weight were optimized through a modifies Gradient Descent Algorithm its AUC turned to be 0.822.
