Predicting diabetic patients using EHR provide by Practice Fusion &amp; Kaggle

In this project, I used data provided by Kaggle and Practice Fusion. Multiple sets of patients information, transcripts, diagnosis, medications and patients allergies were provided in a kaggle competition that was closed in 2012. I should note that this is my first data science project in healthcare using EHR.
